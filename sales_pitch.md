# Fix Bugs 20x Faster - From Zero to Incident Superhero

## The Problem

I've wasted hours staring at stack traces, guessing what might be wrong:

- Endless Rails.logger.info statements
- Random code changes hoping something works
- Frustrating debugging sessions that go nowhere
- The feeling of helplessness when production issues hit

## The Solution

A systematic approach to debugging that actually works. In this hands-on workshop, you'll:

1. **Learn a 5-step process** for making any software observable
2. **Practice with real code** - debug a real Rails app with a hidden defect
3. **Master modern tools** - Dynatrace, structured logging, and metrics
4. **Walk away with a cheat sheet** you can use immediately

## What You'll Get

- A proven methodology for debugging (The Five Steps to Observable Software)
- Hands-on experience with industry-standard observability tools
- Real-world debugging skills you can use the next day
- Confidence to tackle any production issue

## Who This Is For

- Engineers tired of guessing at bugs
- Teams struggling with production issues
- Anyone who wants to debug faster and with confidence

## What You'll Do

1. Set up a real Rails app with a hidden defect
2. Use modern observability tools to find the issue
3. Fix the bug using data, not guesswork
4. Walk away with a process you can use immediately

## The Bottom Line

Stop guessing. Start debugging with confidence. Fix bugs 20x faster.
